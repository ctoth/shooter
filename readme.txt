What's going on here?

This is an experiment to connect environmental audio, an off-the-shelf physics engine, a newly-invented level description language and a few other bits of fluff and stuff to make a state of the art accessible game engine.

The current content is autogenerated from map.yml and is all test material which will most-likely be replaced.

I am using this engine for the development of a top-down fps-style rpg called Farmer Bob and the Alien Anal Probe.

Actually, I haven't settled on a title, but here's a draft of the teaser:

Farmer Bob is a good oal southern boy, likes raising his cattle and shootin at them damn Coyotes.
One summer's night he wakes up to hear his dogs going crazy and sees a bright light out in the east pasture. He stumbles out onto the front porch, grabs his Machete, and makes his way over to check it out, only to find a weird glowing crop circle, and something that looks like a manhole cover in the middle of it.

He goes down the manhole, and finds a weird, glowing silvery structure populated with aliens. Lots of labs where they are doing experiments on his cattle... lots of just weird alien shit.
 
He traverses a couple levels like this, deeper and deeper into the weird silvery thing. Discovers that the aliens have captured and imprisoned people from his home town, like the mayor.
HE has to rescue them, beat the aliens, and when he's done and has finally killed the big baddy, the silvery structure ends up, of course, being a spaceship, and depending on how much machinery he's destroyed on his way to capture it, he might even be able to fly it, which leaves things open for the sequel... in spaaaace.

So, some particularly fun elements of this are going to be stuff like, as a southerner, farmer bob's reactions to the stuff he sees.
Stuff like, well good god damn, whatcha reckon that does? and the like when interacting with objects.

I have spoken to Bryan Smart about having him record the Farmer Bob/main character parts.

I'm soliciting early feedback on this so as to be able to change things while the engine is still in its early days.

I hope to be able to use this engine as the base for several more games, and am open to working with partners on other creative concepts leveraging this technology.
